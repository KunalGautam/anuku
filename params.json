You can use it to setup a simple website with zero or minimal configuration.\r\n\r\nAnuku needs \"zero configuration\" to start with and is great in design. It looks/behaves very elegantly on all browsers/devices (we still recommend not to fall back to IE8 or below for obvious reasons).\r\n\r\n[View Anuku Screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/98vXk/all)\r\n\r\n**Using:**\r\n\r\n1. Php as the coding language\r\n\r\n2. MySQL as database\r\n\r\n3. Git for version control\r\n\r\n4. Bootstrap for UI\r\n\r\n**Contributors:**\r\n\r\n* *Anurag*    -\tanurag@eanurag.com\r\n\r\n* *Kunal*\t-\tkunal@ikunal.in\r\n\r\n###Note: This is only an Alpha release.
