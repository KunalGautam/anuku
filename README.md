##Content Management Simplified##

Our first effort to create a basic and minimalistic CMS (Content Management System), to see if it actually works? :) and to learn a lot from it !

**Using:**

1. Php as the coding language

2. MySQL as database

3. Git for version control

4. Bootstrap for UI

.... and made with Love &amp; Simplicity.
